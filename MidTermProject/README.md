# Description of the problem

## Dataset
The source of the data is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxbrain/nyc-building-energy-data
The corresponding .xlsx file is saved under <code>./data/raw/nyc_benchmarking_disclosure_2017_consumption_data.xlsx</code>. In this .xlsx we only use the "Information and Metrics" tab.

We consider the following regression problem: using the dataset above we develop a model that can predict a building's EnergyStar score (independent variable) and assess it's quality using cross validation as well as hold out testing dataset.

## CrossValidation strategy

## Choosing and saving the final model

## Serving the final model

## Deploying the model using Docker and ElasticBean on AWS
